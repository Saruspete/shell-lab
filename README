====== SHELL LAB ======

Welcome to the Shell Laboratory... We aim to provide a set of 

==== /examples: full scripts examples

This folder should contain sample scripts that are self-sufficient and serve
an usual purpose.


==== /snippets: snippets of code to be reused in your scripts


==== /tests: testing zone for features and differences between shells


  - dataset/       Dataset to be used for the tests
  - interpreters/  Shell interpreters to be used for the tests
  - tests/         The tests, grouped by 


== interpreters


== tests

The tests are small pieces of code where they produce an output to be expected.
This expected output is placed in a .out file, having the same name as the
script.

Each test is expected to have a header to be parsed to give its arguments,
expected return code, and other details to be searched for


===== Writing new tests

As an example, if you want to create example1, you'll have to create:
- example1.sh:       The shell script doing the behavior to be tested
- example1.check.sh: Will check the results of example1.sh are as expected.

The check script will be called 2 times, each with the step as first argument:
- pre : Just before the run
- post: Just after the run. The 2nd argument is the return code of the script
